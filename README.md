# Machine Learning - k-Means Clustering
k-Means Clustering code example

Assumption: You already understand the concept of k-Means Clustering, sse, and elbow method

Given: Given set data without class. Each data have two attributes with float values. Use train set on Trainset.txt file to cluster the data. Use k-Means clustering to cluster given data set. Find the best value of k with elbow method using sse (sum square error).

Goal: To find best value of k

Hint:
1. The code only show the result with a value of k
2. When you run the code it will ask for k value then show the sse, position the centroid and generate file result.txt
3. File result.txt contains the result of clustering according to input k's value
4. Elbow method mean, you must do some trial
5. I've put the solution on file solution.rar on this repository
6. For code's guide open file Guide.txt
